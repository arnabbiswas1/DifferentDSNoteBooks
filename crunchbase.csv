Silvan’s founders started the company with a view to make people’s lives safer and more secure. They kick-started their operations in Bangalore with a simple yet effective solution – Internet Protocol (IP) cameras with built-in intelligence to detect events automatically. As the business started to take its own shape, Silvan expanded its scope by entering into the sphere of home automation based on contemporary technologies such as cloud services and the Internet of Things.
Ubiquitous access to the home automation system from the smart phone was first on the list of priorities for Silvan’s founders. They were keen on creating a generation of new-age automation where smart phones could be used to control all the appliances and devices in a house. The focus was also on being a ‘complete solutions company’ rather than being just a ‘product company’. Silvan’s objective is simple – to cater to an evolving Indian lifestyle, which demands a fresh approach, wherein a modern and traditional way of life can co-exist.
Silvan’s solutions for home automation has been welcomed by several big players in the field of housing – Sobha, Brigade, Nambiar Builders, Total Environment, Tata Housing, and Lodha to name a few.
Spurred on by the magnitude of success the company has achieved in home automation in the Indian market, Silvan is now looking to expand into other geographies. It is also working on new products that would increase its footprint amongst the consumers.

As enterprises' data & analytics needs have evolved, they have learnt that social insights can be critical in a variety of complex, increasingly non-trivial scenarios. That's where Frrole steps in, leveraging its Machine Learning and AI algorithms to provide signals from social data that traditional tools have been unable to provide.
Traditional Social Analytics/Listening products focus on providing their customers statistics, sentiment and some more linguistic data about their brand and campaign on social media. Frrole turns the logic on its head by using wealth of social data as a reverse proxy to tell its customers what is happening with their consumers, irrespective of where they are.
Frrole's customers include some of the world's most trusted brands and sophisticated data consumers like Twitter, GroupM, Unilever, Flipkart, US Department of State etc.

Nor, did we look at eliminating storage altogether and working with just one layer of compute and storage. We actually like storage (for a good number of reasons) – just not in the current form – we want our storage to be a lot more intelligent, flexible, fully shared, easily manageable, and ready to handle thousands of applications and their varying performance demands with a single click.
We have built next-generation storage technology that for the first time enables enterprise applications to be run in cloud environments.
We redefine storage beyond capacity in terms of throughput, latency, and IOPS. Together with linear scaling, this enables a single extensible storage platform compared to fragmented storage with legacy solutions. We also made efficient management a fundamental part of the architecture rather than an afterthought. As a result, we make it dramatically easier to afford and manage storage for thousands of applications in today’s virtualized datacenter. We also enable higher reliability and security than you've ever witnessed before.

0,Remidio Innovative Solutions,2009,11 - 50,"Remidio is engaged in designing & developing Smart, Innovative & Disruptive Imaging Technologies in Vision Care, using a product development approach called “Design Thinking”.
As part of the Design Thinking process, Remidio takes into account different facets of a customer’s experience with a product, as part of its overall product design approach, with the intent of inventing a new customer experience with the product.
Customers can be an amazing resource to glean insight and understanding, but they are generally not able to articulate their latent and anticipated needs. Remidio hence focuses on making quick functional prototypes, that can then be given to the customer to understand these latent needs while observing their use of the prototypes.
Founded by professionals with a passion for product innovation, Remidio is currently focussed on creating game changing products and solutions in the ophthalmology space.
We look at constraints posed by a developing nation context- infrastructure, skilled resources and affordable pricing as an opportunity to innovate.
We bring to market very high quality products that are reliable and extremely simple to use.
